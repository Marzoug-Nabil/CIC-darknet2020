Welcome to the CICdarknet2020 Dataset repository! This repository serves as a centralized resource for the CICdarknet2020 dataset, which is a comprehensive collection of network traffic captures for cybersecurity research and analysis.
Note that this repo covers only a few parts of the whole projects. The repo gives an overview about the preprocessing part and feature selection. This final work that covers all the parts ( Data centric-part, Model-centric part) will be handed soon one the work is done and the **research paper** is sumbitted.

## About the Dataset

The CICdarknet2020 dataset is a curated collection of real-world network traffic captures from various sources, covering a wide range of network activities, including normal traffic, as well as various cyber attacks and anomalies. The dataset is specifically designed to facilitate research and analysis in the field of cybersecurity, network intrusion detection, and machine learning-based threat detection.
