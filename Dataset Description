In CICDarknet2020 dataset, a two-layered approach is used to generate benign and darknet traffic at the first layer. 
The darknet traffic constitutes Audio-Stream, Browsing, Chat, Email, P2P, Transfer, Video-Stream and VOIP which is generated at the second layer. 
To generate the representative dataset, we amalgamated our previously generated datasets, namely, ISCXTor2016 and ISCXVPN2016, and combined the respective VPN and Tor traffic in corresponding Darknet categories.
